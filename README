micro-la.h
===============

Linear algebra types and functions as an header-only library with a
C99 and C11 api.

THIS LIBRARY IS NOT FINISHED

Author:  Giovanni Santini
Mail:    giovanni.santini@proton.me
Github:  @San7o


Features
--------

The library provides generic definitions and transformations for
the types:

  - Vec2
  - Vec3
  - Vec4
  - Quaternion
  - Rect
  - Circle
  - Triangle


Usage
-----

Do this:

  #define MICRO_LA_IMPLEMENTATION

before you include this file in *one* C or C++ file to create the
implementation.

i.e. it should look like this:

  #include ...
  #include ...
  #include ...
  #define MICRO_LA_IMPLEMENTATION
  #include "micro-la.h"

You can tune the library by #defining certain values. See the
"Config" comments under "Configuration" below.


Code
----

The official git repository of micro-la.h is hosted at:

    https://github.com/San7o/micro-la.h

This is part of a bigger collection of header-only C99 libraries
called "micro-headers", contributions are welcome:

TODO
----

 - TODO: implement quaternion rotations for any axes
 - TODO: add rotations to shapes Rect and Triangle
 - TODO: add vector operations like add, sub, dot, eq, ...
 - TODO: add generic poligons with any number of vertices
